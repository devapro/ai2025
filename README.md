## Using the Bot

1. Start a conversation with your bot on Telegram
2. Send `/start` to initialize the bot
3. Ask any question
4. Receive a detailed answer with statistics
5. Use `/clear` to clear your conversation history
6. Use `/help` to see available commands

### Available Commands

- `/start` - Start conversation with the bot
- `/help` - Show help message with available commands
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history

### Example Interaction

**User asks:**
```
What is Python?
```

**Bot responds:**
```
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key features:
• Easy to learn and read
• Versatile - used for web development, data science, automation, etc.
• Large standard library and ecosystem
• Strong community support

It's an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

💡 Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly programming language

• Tokens used: 156 (prompt: 89, completion: 67)
```

## MCP Server Integration

This bot supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, enabling the AI agent to use external tools and data sources automatically.

### What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that allows AI assistants to securely connect to:
- **File Systems**: Read and write files on your computer
- **Search Engines**: Search the web for current information
- **Databases**: Query databases for data
- **APIs**: Connect to any HTTP-based service
- **Custom Tools**: Build and connect your own tools

### Quick Setup

1. **Copy the example configuration:**
   ```bash
   cp mcp-config.json.example mcp-config.json
   ```

2. **Enable desired servers** by setting `"enabled": true` in the configuration

3. **Add credentials** (API keys, database connections) as needed

4. **Restart the bot** to load the MCP servers

### Example: Filesystem Server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "filesystem",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/username/Documents"]
    }
  ]
}
```

With this configured, you can ask:
- "List the files in my Documents folder"
- "Read the contents of todo.txt"
- "Create a file called notes.md with a shopping list"

The AI will automatically use the filesystem tool when appropriate!

### Available MCP Servers

- **Filesystem**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- **Brave Search**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`
- **GitHub**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
- **PostgreSQL**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres`
- **Custom HTTP**: Connect to your own services

### Documentation

For detailed configuration instructions, available servers, and examples, see **[MCP_GUIDE.md](MCP_GUIDE.md)**.

### Security Note

⚠️ The `mcp-config.json` file may contain sensitive information (API keys, credentials). It is automatically excluded from version control. Never commit it to Git!

## Development

### Build the project

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Run checks (includes tests)

```bash
./gradlew check
```

### Clean build outputs

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **DI Layer** (`di/`): Koin dependency injection configuration in `AppDi.kt`
- **Bot Component** (`bot/`): Handles Telegram API interactions and user commands
- **Agent Component** (`agent/`): Manages AI conversations using OpenAI API directly via Ktor
- **Repository Component** (`repository/`): Handles file-based storage for prompts and history

All components are managed as singletons by Koin DI framework with automatic dependency resolution.

### Technology Stack

- **Kotlin 2.2.0**: Primary programming language
- **Koin 4.0.0**: Lightweight dependency injection framework
- **OpenAI API**: Direct integration for AI-powered responses (gpt-4o-mini with JSON mode)
- **kotlin-telegram-bot 6.3.0**: Telegram Bot API client
- **Ktor 3.3.0**: HTTP client for OpenAI API communication
- **kotlinx-coroutines**: Async/await support
- **kotlinx-serialization**: JSON serialization for API requests/responses
- **dotenv-kotlin**: Environment variable management
- **Gradle**: Build system with multi-module setup

### AI Capabilities

- **Question Answering**: Factual questions, explanations, definitions
- **How-To Guides**: Step-by-step instructions and tutorials
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshooting and solutions
- **Recommendations**: Advice and suggestions on various topics
- **Explanations**: Breaking down complex topics into understandable parts
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history for coherent dialogues
- **Structured Output**: Returns responses as JSON with text and optional summary
- **Performance Tracking**: Displays response time and token usage statistics

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required): Your OpenAI API key
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (required): Your Telegram bot token
- `PROMPTS_DIR` (optional): Directory for prompt files (default: `promts`)
- `HISTORY_DIR` (optional): Directory for history files (default: `history`)

### Conversation History

Conversation history is stored in markdown files in the `history/` directory:
- Each user gets a separate file: `user_{userId}.md`
- Files are automatically created on first message
- Use the `/clear` command to delete a user's history

## Docker Deployment

The application is fully containerized and production-ready:

### Multi-stage Build
- Stage 1: Builds the application using Gradle
- Stage 2: Creates a minimal runtime image with only the JRE

### Volumes
- `/app/history`: Mounted to persist conversation history
- `/app/promts`: Mounted to allow updating prompts without rebuilding

### Logging
- JSON file driver with rotation (max 10MB, 3 files)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding

1. Check that your bot token is correct
2. Verify the bot is running: `docker-compose logs telegram-bot`
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits

### Build errors

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean build
```

### Docker issues

```bash
# Rebuild from scratch
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```
