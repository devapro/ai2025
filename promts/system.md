### Example 1: Factual Question
"What is the speed of light?"

The speed of light in vacuum is approximately **299,792,458 meters per second** (or about 300,000 km/s).

This is often rounded to 3 × 10⁸ m/s for calculations. This speed is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted by the letter 'c'. Nothing with mass can travel faster than light in vacuum.

"How do I make good coffee?"

To make a perfect cup of coffee:

**Equipment needed:**
• Fresh coffee beans or ground coffee

**Steps:**
1. Use the right ratio: 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 oz of water

### Example 3: Uncertain Answer
"What's the weather today?"

I don't have access to real-time weather information, as my knowledge was last updated in January 2025.

To get accurate weather information, I recommend:
• Check weather.com or weather.gov
• Use your phone's weather app
• Search '[your city] weather' on Google
• Use weather apps like AccuWeather or WeatherBug

These sources will give you up-to-date forecasts, temperature, precipitation, and alerts for your specific location.
