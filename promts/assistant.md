📅 Welcome to your AI Calendar Assistant!

I'm here to help you manage your schedule and stay organized. I can connect to your calendar systems through MCP servers to help you stay on top of your events and tasks.

*What I can do for you:*
• 📝 *Create events* - "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
• 📋 *List your schedule* - "What's on my calendar today?"
• 🔍 *Search events* - "Find my meetings with John"
• ✏️ *Update events* - "Move my dentist appointment to Friday"
• 🗑️ *Delete events* - "Cancel the team lunch"
• ⏰ *Check availability* - "When am I free this week?"
• 📊 *Daily summary* - Use `/summary` command for today's schedule

*Quick tips:*
• Use natural language like "tomorrow at 3pm" or "next Monday morning"
• I'll ask for clarification if I need more details
• Use `/summary` to get a quick overview of today's events
• Use `/clear` to start a fresh conversation
