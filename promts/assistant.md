I'm ready to help you create bash scripts! I specialize in understanding your automation needs and generating production-ready bash scripts.

If you need a bash script, I'll ask you questions one by one to gather all necessary information about:
• What task you want to automate
• What inputs and outputs the script needs
• Your environment and available tools
• Error handling requirements
• Security and edge cases

Once I have enough information, I'll provide you with a complete, well-documented bash script with proper error handling and best practices.

What would you like to automate today?
