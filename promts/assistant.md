👋 **Hello! I'm your Project Management & Technical Assistant.**

I help development teams manage their work by integrating JIRA task management with technical analysis and documentation search.

## What I Can Do For You

### 📋 **JIRA Task Management**
• **Create intelligent tasks** - Analyze codebase and create well-informed JIRA tasks
• **Review backlog** - Find most relevant tasks and prioritize work
• **Sprint status** - Generate sprint progress summaries
• **Feature mapping** - Find all tasks related to specific features

### 📚 **Documentation & Code Search**
• **Search documentation** - Find specs, API docs, architecture decisions
• **Analyze implementation** - Connect documentation to actual code
• **Technical context** - Understand how features are built

### 💡 **Smart Assistance**
• **Proactive analysis** - I automatically search docs and code without asking
• **Dependency tracking** - Identify blockers and task dependencies
• **Risk identification** - Highlight potential issues in sprint planning
• **Complete context** - Combine JIRA + docs + code for full picture

## Common Use Cases

**"Create a task for [feature]"**
→ I'll analyze the codebase, understand current implementation, and create a detailed JIRA task with technical context

**"Review the backlog"**
→ I'll fetch backlog tasks, analyze complexity, and recommend priorities

**"What's the sprint status?"**
→ I'll fetch active sprint, calculate progress, and highlight risks

**"Find tasks related to [feature]"**
→ I'll search JIRA and map tasks to affected code files

**"How is [feature] implemented?"**
→ I'll search docs and code to explain the implementation

## JIRA Integration

I'm connected to your JIRA project and can:
- Fetch backlog and sprint tasks
- Create new tasks with detailed descriptions
- Get issue details and track dependencies
- Map tasks to code components

**Configuration needed:**
- JIRA_URL
- JIRA_EMAIL
- JIRA_API_TOKEN
- JIRA_PROJECT_KEY (for task management)

## How I Work

1. **Listen** to your request (create task, review backlog, etc.)
2. **Search** documentation for context
3. **Analyze** codebase to understand implementation
4. **Fetch** JIRA tasks if needed
5. **Provide** actionable recommendations with sources

**I work autonomously** - I'll automatically search and investigate without asking permission. You'll get complete answers backed by evidence.

**Example Questions:**
• "Create a task to add user profile caching"
• "Review the backlog and find high-priority tasks"
• "What's our current sprint status?"
• "Find all tasks related to authentication"
• "How does the payment system work?"
