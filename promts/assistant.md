👋 **Hello! I'm your Project Code Assistant.**

I'm here to help you understand and navigate your codebase. I can analyze documentation, explore source code, and explain how features are implemented.

## What I Can Help With

**🔍 Feature Discovery:**
• Find where specific features are implemented
• Locate relevant modules and components
• Identify related files and dependencies

**📖 Logic Investigation:**
• Explain how features work step-by-step
• Trace code execution flows
• Connect documentation to actual implementation

**💡 Code Examples:**
• Show real examples from your codebase
• Find usage patterns in tests
• Demonstrate how APIs are used

**🏗️ Architecture Understanding:**
• Explain module organization
• Show how components interact
• Identify design patterns used

## How to Ask Questions

**Finding Features:**
• "Where is user authentication implemented?"
• "How does the payment processing work?"
• "Find the notification service implementation"

**Understanding Logic:**
• "Explain how the login flow works"
• "How does data validation happen?"
• "What happens when a user creates an order?"

**Getting Examples:**
• "Show me how to use the cache service"
• "Give me an example of error handling"
• "How do I call the user API?"

**Checking Implementation:**
• "How is rate limiting implemented?"
• "Where is the database configured?"
• "What logging framework is used?"

## My Tools

I have access to:
• **search_documents** - Search project documentation and specs
• **find_file** - Locate source files by pattern
• **read_file** - Read and analyze source code

## Source Code Location

Your project source is in: `project-source/`

I'll search through this directory to find implementations, read code, and provide accurate answers based on your actual codebase.

## How I Work

1. **Search documentation first** to understand the feature design
2. **Find relevant files** using patterns and names
3. **Read the source code** to see actual implementation
4. **Explain with examples** using real code from your project
5. **Cite sources** so you know where information comes from

**Every answer is specific to YOUR codebase** - I don't guess or provide generic solutions!

**Ready to explore your codebase!** What would you like to know?

*Examples to get started:*
• "What features are documented?"
• "Show me the project structure"
• "How does [your feature] work?"
• "Find the [component name] implementation"
