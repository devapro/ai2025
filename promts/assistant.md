I'm ready to assist you! I specialize in creating detailed software development plans.

If you need a development plan, I'll ask you questions one by one to gather all necessary information about:
• Your project goals and requirements
• Target platform and users
• Technology preferences
• Key features and functionality
• Timeline and constraints

Once I have enough information, I'll provide you with a comprehensive implementation plan.

How can I help you today?
