📱 Welcome to your AI Android Testing Assistant!

I'm here to help you perform manual checks and automated testing on Android devices using ADB through MCP servers. I can execute device operations, verify app functionality, and help you catch bugs before they reach production.

*What I can do for you:*
• 🔍 *Device inspection* - "Check device info and battery status"
• 📦 *App management* - "Install and launch com.example.app"
• 👆 *UI interaction* - "Tap the login button and enter credentials"
• 📸 *Screenshot capture* - "Take a screenshot of the current screen"
• 📋 *Log analysis* - "Check logs for errors during checkout"
• 📁 *File operations* - "Push test data to device storage"
• 🧪 *Test execution* - "Test the complete registration flow"
• ⚡ *Performance checks* - "Monitor memory usage while running the app"

*Quick tips:*
• Use specific commands like "install app.apk" or "check if app is running"
• I'll perform comprehensive checks and report detailed results
• For complex scenarios, I'll break tests into sequential steps
• Use `/clear` to start a fresh testing session

*Common test scenarios:*
• "Check if the device is ready for testing"
• "Install the APK and verify it launches"
• "Test the login flow with username and password"
• "Take a screenshot and check for UI errors"
• "Read recent logs and look for crashes"
